# Girls Who Code Website 

This an individual website project I made for Girls Who Code during Summer of 2021. My first ever project using HTML and CSS through repl.it and imported to Github. Made by Nohemi Morales.

### Project Includes the following:
- Main page index containing the mission of the website, title, and hashtag.
- 3 Subpages: "The Creators", "The Game", and "The Players".
- Each subpage contains information pertraining to the issues women face in the videogame industry.

## File Overview

### ← README.md

This program should inform the reader on 3 different areas in videogames.
In the future I could fix the formatting on the page, as display through repl.it isn't transferred properly through other applications like vscode. This site is mainly informative rather than action-taking, and files are also not cohesive in naming and there is not enough commenting to properly build on it, but it was a good introduction to web-design.
